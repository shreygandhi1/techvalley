    <p class="para">
        The Nothing Ear Stick is priced at Rs. 8,499 in India, and admittedly looks and feels quite impressive for a pair of earphones in this price segment.there is a lot more to a pair of true wireless earphones than design, and the Nothing Ear Stick does have some considerable drawbacks as a result of this seemingly single-minded focus of making the earphones look and feel unique. How do these earphones fare on the whole? Find out in this review.

               <h4><b style="padding-left:2em;">Nothing Ear Stick design and features</b></h4>
    <p class="para">
       Nothing introduced its transparency-based design language with the Nothing Ear 1 in 2021, and the Nothing Ear Stick largely carries the ideas forward. However, there are some visible changes in the design, notably in the fit of the earpieces and in the charging case. Some of these elements have also impacted the feature set on the Nothing Ear Stick.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        The big change, as mentioned, is in the fit of the Nothing Ear Stick. There are no ear tips since the speaker grilles are built directly into the large part of the earpieces. The outer part of the earpieces looks almost entirely like the Nothing Ear 1, with a transparent casing and colour-coding to identify the left and right earpieces, along with the product name etched on the inside. Although this styling is no longer as unique and innovative, the Nothing Ear Stick still looks very good.
    </p>
    <h4><b style="padding-left:2em;">Nothing Ear Stick app and specifications</b></h4>
         <p class="para">
            Previously called ‘Nothing Ear 1', the app has been renamed to ‘Nothing X' to make it a bit clearer for users of the Nothing Ear Stick (and indeed any products the brand might launch in the future). The app is available for iOS and Android, and is as impressively designed as the earphones themselves.
         </p>
                <p class="para">
                    It often took unusually long to connect to the earphones despite the Bluetooth connection having been established, and even putting the smartphone in standby would require the app to re-establish the connection with the earphones.
                </p>
                <asp:Image runat="server" ID="imgear1" ImageUrl="~/assest/nothing_ear_stick_review_app_1668504954611.jpg" CssClass="image" />
                <p class="para">
                    Once done, though, the app worked smoothly enough, with a graphical display of the battery levels commanding much of the screen. You can also adjust the equaliser settings through presets or a graphical custom tool, and customise certain controls for the force-touch buttons on the earpieces.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    The Nothing Ear Stick has 12.6mm dynamic drivers, with Bluetooth 5.2 for connectivity, and support for the SBC and AAC Bluetooth codecs. While advanced Bluetooth codec support might have been a good addition given the lack of ANC, the existing codec support does ensure a uniform listening experience across both Android and iOS devices.
