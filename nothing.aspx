    <p class="para">
      Now that the hype train for the <a target="_blank" href="nothing.aspx">Nothing Phone 1</a> has slowed down a bit, it's time to take a long, hard look behind the light show to find out whether this is indeed a game-changing smartphone in its segment, or whether all the hype was overblown. I've been using the Phone 1 as my primary phone for about a week and I think it's safe to say that most people should be happy with what it offers, especially those who appreciate attention to detail.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        The Phone 1 might not have the over-the-top specifications that some of the competition loves bragging about but it's the combination of little things that add up to a good experience. It's not perfect and there are some kinks that require ironing out, which we'll explore in this review.
    </p>
               <h4><b style="padding-left:2em;">Nothing Phone 1 price in India</b></h4>
    <p class="para">
       Prices for the Nothing Phone 1 in India start at Rs. 32,999 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For Rs. 35,999, you get double the storage (256GB) with the same amount of RAM, and finally at Rs. 38,999 you get 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. These prices seem fine for the sort of features and specs on offer but keep in mind that the Phone 1 doesn't come with a charger or a case, which are accessories that most of the competition offers.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        The Nothing 45W charger is sold separately for Rs. 1,499 and the transparent case also costs the same. The price of the charger is not bad and if you add its cost, the Phone 1 effectively starts at roughly Rs. 34,500. The phone is available in white and black.
    </p>
    <h4><b style="padding-left:2em;">Nothing Phone 1 design </b></h4>
         <p class="para">
             We have already gone over the design of the Nothing Phone 1 quite extensively in our first impressions piece but I do want to point out a few things that I really like after using it for a longer period. The Phone 1 is a very comfortable phone to live with, and in a lot of ways, feels like an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13. The completely flat sides, front and back look very industrial, especially for the black variant.
         </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Nothing has used Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for the display and the back panel, and so I didn't observ any scratches on the rear glass during the review period. However, the pre-applied screen protector over the display managed to pick up plenty of scratches on both my review units after just a week of fairly careful use. Unsurprisingly, Nothing will happily sell you a tempered glass screen protector for Rs. 999.
                </p>
                <asp:Image runat="server" ID="imgnothing1" ImageUrl="~/assest/nothing_phone_1_screen_gadgets360_1658412947844.jpg"  />
                <p class="para">
                    The display of the Nothing Phone 1 is nice, and if you look closely, you'll notice that the borders on all four sides have the same width. Nothing has used a flexible OLED panel which can be folded inwards at the bottom, allowing for the narrow chin, similar to an iPhone. However, not everyone might have favourable things to say about the Phone 1's display. Some early adopters reportedly faced a green tint issue on their screens, while others noticed dead pixels near the selfie camera. Nothing has since acknowledged this and clarified that an upcoming software update should help fix the tinting problem. While defects are not uncommon for a newly launched product (just ask Google), it's definitely not a good look for a startup that's launching its very first smartphone.
                </p> 
                <p class="para">
                    It's time to talk about the Glyph Interface. This is Nothing's way of differentiating itself from the competition and I do appreciate the way it has executed this idea. In my opinion, the lights look better on the black variant solely because white LEDs contrast better with the darker aesthetic. I also love the little red LED here for video recording. However, in terms of actual functionality, I haven't gotten any meaningful use out of it yet. Nothing's default ringtones and notification sounds are quirky and the lights flash in sync to the beat of each tone, plus there's very good haptic feedback.
                </p>  
                <asp:Image runat="server" ID="imgnothing2" ImageUrl="~/assest/nothing_phone_1_glyph_gadgets360_1658412895411.jpg" />
                <p class="para">
                    I can maybe see the Glyph Interface being useful for phone calls – you can have a different light pattern for different people so you know who's calling you just by looking at the lights. But for alerts from apps, there's no way (right now) to bind a glyph to a specific app, so there's no telling if its an important alert or not. Also, if you miss seeing the alert, the lights don't flash a second time which means it might look as though you haven't received any notifications. In fact, Nothing has created a very cool-looking always-on display that I found to be way more functional than the glyph lights.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Besides these main functions, the glyph lights can also be used to check the charging status of the phone and when Google Assistant is triggered. The ‘Flip to Glyph' gesture automatically puts the phone on silent mode and uses just the lights to alert you.
