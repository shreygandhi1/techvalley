      Xiaomi has been taking things slow and steady in the laptop space in India, with just a handful of models launched since it brought the first Mi Notebook here in mid-2020. Rather than attacking every possible price point and buyer profile as it does with phones, Xiaomi seems to have identified its niche – slick, premium models for those who want something better than the basics. The Xiaomi Notebook Pro 120G aims to stand out in terms of design as well as features. While it isn't as affordable as some of the company's previous offerings, there's a value proposition here that might just work for you. Read on.

       Aimed at students, professionals, home users, and the mobile workforce, the<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">Xiaomi Notebook Pro 120G</a> is<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">available starting at Rs. 69,999</a>. The higher-priced variant costs Rs. 76,999 and the only difference between them is that the latter has a discrete<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">Nvidia GeForce MX550 GPU</a> in addition to the integrated Intel graphics capabilities that you get with the base version. Xiaomi inconsistently refers to the less expensive version as the<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">Notebook Pro 120</a> (minus the G, for graphics) – so you might see the two options listed as different models in some places. All other specs are the same, and it's a bit surprising that there are no options when it comes to CPU power, RAM, or SSD capacity.

             The primary draw of the Xiaomi Notebook Pro 120G is its fantastic 2560x1600-pixel 16:10 120Hz screen. The resolution and aspect ratio are great for productivity, giving you a significant amount of extra workspace compared to standard full-HD. Xiaomi promises 100 percent sRGB colour gamut coverage and DC dimming, which means no rapid flickering that might cause eye strain.
         </p>
                <p class="para">
                    Considering that this is a premium laptop, it's surprising that there<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">aren't any CPU options</a> higher than the Core i5-12450H that Xiaomi has chosen. A Core i7 version might have been quite

                    interesting, given what else you get. Nevertheless, this is a 12th Gen model based on the<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">‘Alder Lake'</a> architecture, and more interestingly, the<a href="laptop.aspx" target="_blank">H suffix</a> indicates that this is a relatively powerful 45W part which should deliver better sustained performance than the typical 28W or 15W parts more commonly found in thin-and-light laptops. This CPU has four performance cores and four more smaller efficient cores, for a total of 12 threads.

                    You'll find one Thunderbolt 4 (Type-C) port, an HDMI 2.0 video output, and a 3.5mm audio socket on the left. On the right, there's one USB 3.2 Gen2 (10Gbps) Type-C port, one USB 3.1 (5Gbps) Type-A port, and a charge status LED. That isn't a lot, but at least you have the flexibility to use a Thunderbolt dock or adapters to drive multiple external displays and other peripherals. More USB ports and an SD card slot would have been particularly useful – this laptop isn't too thin or otherwise short on space. For wireless connectivity there's Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.

                    Full-HD movies and shows on streaming services look decent enough on the 14-inch screen, and the Xiaomi Notebook Pro 120G should serve just fine for casual entertainment. The stereo speakers are just about okay for dialogue in video and effects in games, but they aren't great with music. The webcam is also serviceable but nothing special.
